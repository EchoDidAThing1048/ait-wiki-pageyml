## Create a Datapack
- Follow the tutorial on the [Minecraft Wiki on datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) on how to set one up, use the namespace from earlier

- You can lock any dimension from any mod, or even vanilla minecraft.

- Create a new **.json** file in the path

> `data/(namespace)/blahblah/(dimension_name_i_think).json`

- Inside this new .json file, paste

> ```json
> {
> I HAVE NO IDEA, I BLAME THE OTHER DEVS FOR NOT DOCUMENTING WHAT THEY MAKE!
> }
> ```

- Replace the **this** with THAT.

- Something about changing the item that you use.

- Now put this **datapack** into Minecraft.
