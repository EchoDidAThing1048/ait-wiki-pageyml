## Subsystems/circuits

These new subsystems/circuits are needed to activate and or use certain functions of the TARDIS,they'll need power.

## How do i use them?

You use them by right clicking a generalized subsystem core to set its type,then build a structure if it has one and then link it up to the engine via fluid links

* WARNING SOME CIRCUITS HAVE DURABILITY,DURABILITY IS EXPLAINED IN MECHANICS.

## How do i make them?

Blueprints and the fabricator!

## What circuits are there and what do they do?

* Demat circuit,needed to demateralize and remateralize.

* Has a structure

* Backup circuit,transfers artron to the TARDIS once it runs out of power.

* Chameleon circuit,needed to switch exteriors,cloak and use the adaptive exterior.

* Desperation circuit,allows the usage of siege mode/protocols.
