## What does it do?

The Stattenheim Remote is similar to `tardis` mode that the sonic screwdriver has but this is a bit different, It's INFINITE. This means that with this item you can summon the tardis to you in any dimension and from any distance. Also if you are curious on how long your tardis is taking, you can see its flight percentage (to do so hover over the Stattenheim remote in your inventory and hold `shift`).

# How do i use it?

- First it will need linking to a tardis!

- Next; go to where you want your tardis to go, look at the specific block and press `right-click` (you will hear a sound to indicate your tardis is on its way!)
