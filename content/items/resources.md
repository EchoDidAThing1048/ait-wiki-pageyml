## What are these things?

These are the new resources that are used to craft things via the fabricator n blueprints.
* All the fluid/mercurial links are made via the fabricator as they have blueprints
* The rest have their own crafting recopies.

## Here are the recepies of the non blueprint items

# Subsystems/circuits

These new subsystems/circuits are needed to activate and or use certain functions of the TARDIS,they'll need power.

## How do i use them?

You use them by right clicking a generalized subsystem core to set its type,then build a structure if it has one and then link it up to the engine via fluid links

* WARNING SOME CIRCUITS HAVE DURABILITY,DURABILITY IS EXPLAINED IN MECHANICS.

## How do i make them?

Blueprints and the fabricator!

## What circuits are there and what do they do?

* Demat circuit,needed to demateralize and remateralize.

* Backup circuit,transfers artron to the TARDIS once it runs out of power.

* Chameleon circuit,needed to switch exteriors,cloak and use the adaptive exterior.

* Desperation circuit,allows the usage of siege mode/protocols.

* Gravitational circuit,unlocks anti-mavs and RWF

* Life support,gives constant regeneration within the TARDIS.

* Stabalisers,unlocks P116 (auto-pilot)

* Shield circuit,unlocks both shield types
