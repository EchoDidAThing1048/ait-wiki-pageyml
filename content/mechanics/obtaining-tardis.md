## Growing A TARDIS Coral
Some prior information, you will need to obtain **soul sand** and a **nether star** or **charged zeiton**, 
we suggest you read this [**rift chunk**](../../mechanics/rift-chunks) webpage as it is necessary to find one of these in the world before you can begin the process.
To **grow** a TARDIS, follow these step-by-step instructions: 

1. To start, you will need to craft a TARDIS Coral (top right).
2. Once a [**rift chunk**](../../mechanics/rift-chunks) is located, you will need to place down a **soul sand** block that is exposed to direct skylight (middle right).
3. Place the **coral** on top of the soul sand block.
4. Once you have placed the coral down, you will need to wait for anywhere between 3-12 minutes (this is also dependent entirely on tick speed).
5. To enter the coral use the Singularity matrix subsystem on it,this allows it to progress to the last stage.

## Restoring the TARDIS
The TARDIS will be ***unusable*** until it has rematerialised and selected a random interior/exterior after the **nether star** or a **charged zeiton crystal** has been used,to unlock the functions of the TARDIS you'll need the circuits/subsystems and the engine.

To restore a TARDIS follow these steps:

1. Once grown, the coral will present you with a door into the interior dimension it has grown from the [**Artron Energy**](../../mechanics/artron) in the rift.
2. Walk inside the growth, and - once inside - find any water, and toss your **nether star** into it, or your fully **charged zeiton crystal**.
3. Vacate the interior and wait for your TARDIS to rematerialise.
4. Setup the engine and the circuits to unlock the functions you want.
