Nah mate, it's the TARDIS star get it right this is AIT duh.

## What does it do?
When the engine has been placed down the TARDIS Star will spawn far under the **TARDIS interior** and will spin infinitly. When **The TARDIS** is refueling the TARDIS Star's Rays begin pulsing. plus it's also really gigantic :3
