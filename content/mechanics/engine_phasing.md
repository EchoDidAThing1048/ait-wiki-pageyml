## What? 
Engine phasing is a new negative consequence of your demat circuit being low durability,once the circuit reaches 0-10 durability engine phasing may randomly occure,if it goes threw the following things happen

* TARDIS position randomized
* TARDIS Demateralizes
* Demat circuit destroyed

## How do i counter this?

+ Turn power off
+ Keep circuit durability high
+ Use sonic on the exterior to cancel engine phasing
+ The handbrake will not stop engine phasing.
