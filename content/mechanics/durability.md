## WHY MUST YOU DO THIS TO US?
Yes yes i get it durability might seem scary at first,but fear not as our durability isent a major pain in the ass.

* To increase durability simply right click the subsystem/circuit with zeiton or iron,this increases the durability by 5.
* Not all subsystems/circuits have durability.
* Subsystems/circuits do not break when they get to 0 durability,they just stop working till you repair them.
* The only exeption for this is the demat circuit which can break due to engine phasing.

## What if i run out of durability?

Depends,circuits/subsystems wont break if you run out of it but they'll malfunction,as a example

* Chameleon circuit will randomize instead of selecting the designated exterior
* Demat circuit can engine phase if under 10 durability,this causes the circuit to break.

## How do i see durability?
  Sonic in scanning mode.

## How does durability go down?

* For the engine durability slowly goes passivly down
* For the othere circuits/subsystems that have durability they'll go down if the action they have is used (example if you fly with the demat circuit the demat circuits durability goes down)

## How do i increase / fix low durability systems?

 You can `right click ` on the block with low durability using; iron,copper,gold to increase the durability / repair it.
