## FAQ

#### Q: Why doesn't BOTI work, glitch my screen?
A: Install the `Chloride` mod with the `embeddium` mod!

#### Q: Why does it crash on my server?
A: You need a mod called `Hammer` found at the bottom of this page [HERE](https://modrinth.com/mod/ait/version/1.0.0+1.2.7)

#### Q: Where can I report an issue for forge?
A: On the AIT github page, but make sure to select `Forge` under the `Mod loader` tab!

#### Q: When will forge updates come out?
A: Some time after the fabric update (could be weeks, could be months).

#### Q: My blocks stop breaking with AIT forge?
A: This is an issue with block tags, using the [Load my F***ing Tags](https://modrinth.com/mod/lmft) mod seems to fix this.
