![Monitor](images/monitor.png)

The **Monitor** is your way to change settings, customise your TARDIS and view TARDIS info. 
The TARDIS monitor is included with the [**TARDIS Console**](../console) but you can craft it as a block and can use it anywhere in your interior rather than just your [**Console**](../console).

## Customizing Your TARDIS
In the monitor you can customise your TARDIS like the Exterior, Interior and the Hum. For how to change it is said in [**Customizing your TARDIS**](../../mechanics/tardis/customizing) page.

## TARDIS Information
When looking at the right side of the monitor it will display a few things, on the top will display where your **TARDIS** is with the coordinates, dimension and where it's facing too. Next, the middle will display how long your flight is with a progress bar. Then on the bottom will display where your target destination is like the **coordinates display** and also on the bottom left is the [**Artron Energy**](../../mechanics/artron) bar that shows how much energy you have in your **TARDIS**.

The menu on the top will say **Settings** click into it and it will preview some options for you to choose from, **Cache Console** removes your [**TARDIS Console**](../console) for a **Console Generator** for you to change your TARDIS Console to your liking. 

**Security** lets you choose what **Security Options** you want and is talked about in this [**TARDIS Security**](../../tardis/security) page.
