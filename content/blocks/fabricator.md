![Fabricator Block](images/engine_stuff_blocks/fabricator.png)

## Fabricator?
Yup, AIT now has its own block to create items via blueprints!
Right click it with a blueprint, and it'll ask you to give it certain items,once you give it all the items it'll fabricate you the designated item.
Do note that once you give the fabricator a blueprint the required ammount of resources isent always the same.

This dosent even use up the blueprint!

## Recepie?

***NONE.***
