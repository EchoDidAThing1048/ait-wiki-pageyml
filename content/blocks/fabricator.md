## Fabricator?
Yup, AIT now has its own block to create items via blueprints!
Right click it with a blueprint, and it'll ask you to give it certain items,once you give it all the items it'll fabricate you the desired item.
Do note that required item amount for the blueprint isn't always the same and that it doesn't use up the blueprint once inserted into the fabricator!


* You wont need JEI or anything as the fabricator tells you what items you need to give it but JEI support MAY come in the future.

## Recipe?
