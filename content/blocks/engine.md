## Why Is It So Big?

The Engine is organically based, just like the TARDIS it powers. It will grow depending on the amount and type of components you have connected to it.

## How Do I Use It?

You can place the Engine anywhere inside the TARDIS and attach components to it by using Artron Cables and the Generalized Subsystem Core.

## How Do I Get It?
It is fabricated with a blueprint within the fabricator.
