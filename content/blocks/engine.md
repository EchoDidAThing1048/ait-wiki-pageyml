## WHY IS IT SO BIG??

Its a engine for a interdimensional space ship thats bigger on the inside,sorry but that thing is not gonna be 2 blocks tall and fit right under ya console. Sorry :3

## How do i use it?

The engine is now required for your TARDIS to boot up,if the engine is at low durability or isent present the TARDIS power shuts off.

You'll also have to link the engine to generalized subsystem cores via fluid links.

## How do i get it?

Via the fabricator,you'll need a engine blueprint.
