## Whats this used for?

Since we have planets/space now and you cant really breath on them forever,we added the oxygenator,place it down and in a 16 block radius you'll be able to breath and have normal gravity in peace and you wont freeze to death either.

## Woah thats cool,how do i get it?

***no***
